# Project Title -
 Fugitive Capture Game

# Brief project description or introduction - 

The "Fugitive Capture Game" is an interactive application where users act as law enforcement officers tasked with capturing a fugitive. Players must strategically assign cities and vehicles to each officer to increase the chances of capturing the fugitive. The game simulates various scenarios, challenging players to make optimal choices to successfully capture the fugitive.

# features

1- User Dynamically Add and Select new City and New Vehicle  : Users can dynamically select cities and vehicles for each officer from dropdown menus.
2 - Exclusive Selection: Each law enforcement officer (cop) can select only one city and only one vehicle. Additionally, every cop must select a different city or vehicle, ensuring diversity in choices among officers. This exclusivity prevents duplication of selections and encourages strategic planning among players.

3 - Validation: Validation ensures that users must select both a city and a vehicle for each officer before submitting their choices.

4 - Randomized Fugitive Simulation: The game simulates a fugitive's location and vehicle, adding an element of randomness to the gameplay.

5 - Capture Status Check: After submitting choices, the game checks if any officer successfully captures the fugitive based on their selected city and vehicle.

6 - Alerts: Alerts notify users of incomplete selections or the success/failure of capturing the fugitive.
